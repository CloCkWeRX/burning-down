A moderate cold front is moving through the region and is expected to weaken tonight.<br /> <br />The passage of the front during Thursday afternoon and evening may cause localised damaging wings to 100 kilometres per hour that could result in damage to homes and property. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Abnormally high tides which may cause sea water flooding of low lying areas and very heavy surf which may lead to coastal erosion are forecast for coastal parts of the lower west and south west forecast districts. <br /> <br />Beach conditions in these areas could be dangerous and people should stay well away from the surf and surf exposed areas.</p>
